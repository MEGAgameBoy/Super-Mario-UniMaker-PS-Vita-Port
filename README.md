## Note
For installing custom levels you need to take the '.unis' file and put it in the ux0:app/SMUM30622/games/courses/ folder.
Due to PS Vita limitation yon cannot share the levels created on the PS Vita.
The PS Vita port use a '.univ' file format to save levels. For sharing/exporting levels, see below.

## Sharing/Exporting levels
For sharing/exporting levels you will need to decrypt the '.univ', the best way to do that is by using [Apollo Save Tool](https://github.com/bucanero/apollo-vita/releases) for PS Vita by [bucanero](https://github.com/bucanero).
* First you need to go to Apollo Save Tool and go to Int saves > Super Mario UniMaker > Export decrypted save file then chose the level that you want to export and press X.
* Next your level will be exported in ux0:data/apollo/00/SMUM30622/courses/ you can now transfer your level to a PC using VitaShell USB/FTP connection.
* Finaly make sure to rename file extension form '.univ' to '.unis'.

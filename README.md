## Note
For installing custom levels you need to take the '.unis' file and put it in the ux0:app/SMUM30622/games/courses/ folder.
Due to PS Vita limitation yon cannot share the levels created on the PS Vita.
The PS Vita port use a '.univ' file format to save levels, these files are encrypted by the PS Vita this is the reason why you cannot share them, you can only save it to play/modify them later.
